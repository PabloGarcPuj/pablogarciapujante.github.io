        <H3> <p>Internet security is a <u>range of security tactics for protecting activities and transactions conducted online over the internet.</u>
		These tactics are meant to <u>protect users from threats</u> such as hacking into computer systems, email addresses, or websites; 
		malicious software that can infect and inherently damage systems; and identity theft by hackers who steal personal data such as bank 
		account information and credit card numbers. Internet security is a specific aspect of broader concepts such as cybersecurity and computer security, 
		being focused on the specific threats and vulnerabilities of online access and use of the internet.

In today's digital landscape, many of our daily activities rely on the internet. 
		Various forms of communication, entertainment, and financial and work-related tasks are accomplished online.
		This means that <u>tons of data and sensitive information are constantly being shared over the internet.</u>
		The internet is mostly <u>private and secure,</u> but it can also be an <u>insecure channel for exchanging information.</u>
		With a <u>high risk of intrusion by hackers and cybercriminals</u>, internet security is a top priority for individuals and businesses alike

			<ul>
					 <H2>    <li>Active Attacks</li> </H2>
					<H3> <p>Active attacks are attacks in which the  <u>hacker attempts to change or transform the content of messages or information </u>. 
						These attacks are a  <u>threat to the integrity and availability </u> of the system. Due to these attacks,  <u>systems get damaged, </u> and information can be altered. 
						The  <u>prevention of these attacks is difficult  </u>due to their high range of physical and software vulnerabilities. 
						The damage that is done with these attacks can be very harmful to the system and its resources. But, at least, the  <u>victim is notified about the attack. </u>
						An active attack typically  <u>requires more effort and generally have more difficult implication </u> </p> </H3>

					<H2>    <li>Passive Attacks</li> </H2>
					
					<H3> <p> Passive attacks are the ones in which the <u>attacker observes all the messages and copy the content of messages or information. </u> 
						They focus on <u> monitoring all the transmission </u> and  <u>gaining the data </u>. The attacker does not try to change any data or information he gathered.
						Although there is no potential harm to the system due to these attacks, they can be a significant  <u>danger to your data’s confidentiality. </u>
						These ones are  <u>difficult to detect </u> as it does not involve alteration in data or information.</p> </H3>

		   <ul>
			   <H2> <li>Worms</li> </H2>
			<H3> <p>Worms target vulnerabilities in operating systems to install themselves into networks.
				They may gain access in several ways: through backdoors built into software
				, through unintentional software vulnerabilities, or through flash drives.
				Once in place, worms can be used by malicious actors to launch DDoS attacks, steal sensitive data, or conduct ransomware attacks.</p>

			 <H2> <li>Trojan</li> </H2>
			<H3> <p>A Trojan disguises itself as desirable code or software. Once downloaded by unsuspecting users, 
				the Trojan can take control of victims’ systems for malicious purposes.
				Trojans may hide in games, apps, or even software patches, or they may be embedded in attachments included in phishing emails.</p>

			 <H2> <li>Virus</li> </H2>
			<H3> <p>A virus is a piece of code that inserts itself into an application and executes when the app is run.

				  <H2> <li>Spyware</li> </H2>
			<H3> <p>Spyware collects information about users’ activities without their knowledge or consent.
				This can include passwords, pins, payment information and unstructured messages.
				The use of spyware is not limited to the desktop browser: it can also operate in a critical app or on a mobile phone.</p>

	   <H2>   <li>Software and hardware to protect networks</li> </H2>
			<H3> <p>Network security covers a lot of technologies, devices and processes. 
				It is, basicly, a <u>set of rules and configurations to protect the integrity, 
				confidentiality and accessibility of computer networks</u> and data using software and hardware technologies. 
				Every organization requires a degree of network security solutions in place to protect it from the ever-growing landscape of cyber threats.</p>
				<p>
				A network consists of <u>two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources, exchange files, or allow electronic communications.</u>
				The computers on a network may be <u>linked through cables, telephone lines, radio waves, satellites, or infrared light beams.</u> 
				The communication takes place <u>between computer systems and end devices </u>via local area networks (LAN) 
				and wide area networks (WAN). Information and resources are exchanged every day. </p>	 </H3>	
						
						
						
						
           <H2>    <li>Network protocols</li> </H2>
			<H3> <p> A network protocol is an <u>established set of rules that determine how data is transmitted</u> between different devices in the same network.			
				Network protocols are the <u>reason you can easily communicate with people</u> all over the world.</p>	</H3>
				<ul>
					 <H2>    <li>SSL</li> </H2>
					<H3> <p> SSL is <u>the standard technology for keeping an internet connection secure</u> and safeguarding any sensitive data that is being sent between two systems,
						preventing criminals from reading and modifying any information transferred, including potential personal details.
						The two systems can be a server and a client(shopping website and browser) or server to server (application with personal identifiable information).</p> </H3>
					<H2>    <li>HTTPS</li> </H2>
					
					<H3> <p> HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure) appears in the URL when a website is secured by an SSL certificate. 
						It is the secure version of HTTP, which is the primary protocol used to <u>send data between a web browser and a website.</u>
						HTTPS is <u>encrypted</u> in order to increase security of data transfer.
						This is particularly <u>important when users transmit sensitive data</u> </p> </H3>
					<H2>    <li>IPv6</li> </H2>
					<H3> <p> Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), the most <u>recent version of the Internet Protocol</u> (IP), is a <u>communications protocol</u>
						that <u>gives an identification and location system</u> for computers on networks and routes traffic across the Internet </p> </H3>
				</ul>
				
					
					
	   <H2>   <li>Digital certificates and certificate authorities</li> </H2>
			 <H3> <p> A <u>digital certificate is an electronic document used to prove the ownership of a public key</u>. The certificate includes <u>information about the key</u>, 
				 information about the identity of its owner, and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate's contents . 
				 If the signature is valid, and the software examining the certificate trusts the issuer, then <u>it can use that key to communicate securely with the certificate's subject</u>.</p>
				
				 <p> A <u>certificate authority is an entity that issues digital certificates</u>. A digital certificate <u>certifies the ownership of a
					 public key by the named subject of the certificate.</u> 
					This allows others to rely upon signatures or on assertions made about the private key that corresponds to the certified public key.
					 One particularly common use <u>for certificate authorities is to sign certificates used in HTTPS</u>, the secure browsing protocol for the World Wide Web. 
					 Another common use is in issuing identity cards by national governments for use in electronically signing documents</p>	 </H3>
