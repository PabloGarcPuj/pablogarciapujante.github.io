        <H3> <p>Internet security is a <u>range of security tactics for protecting activities and transactions conducted online over the internet.</u>
		These tactics are meant to <u>protect users from threats</u> such as hacking into computer systems, email addresses, or websites; 
		malicious software that can infect and inherently damage systems; and identity theft by hackers who steal personal data such as bank 
		account information and credit card numbers. Internet security is a specific aspect of broader concepts such as cybersecurity and computer security, 
		being focused on the specific threats and vulnerabilities of online access and use of the internet.

In today's digital landscape, many of our daily activities rely on the internet. 
		Various forms of communication, entertainment, and financial and work-related tasks are accomplished online.
		This means that <u>tons of data and sensitive information are constantly being shared over the internet.</u>
		The internet is mostly <u>private and secure,</u> but it can also be an <u>insecure channel for exchanging information.</u>
		With a <u>high risk of intrusion by hackers and cybercriminals</u>, internet security is a top priority for individuals and businesses alike

			   <H2> <li>Worms</li> </H2>
			<H3> <p>Worms target vulnerabilities in operating systems to install themselves into networks.
				They may gain access in several ways: through backdoors built into software
				, through unintentional software vulnerabilities, or through flash drives.
				Once in place, worms can be used by malicious actors to launch DDoS attacks, steal sensitive data, or conduct ransomware attacks.</p>

			 <H2> <li>Trojan</li> </H2>
			<H3> <p>A Trojan disguises itself as desirable code or software. Once downloaded by unsuspecting users, 
				the Trojan can take control of victims’ systems for malicious purposes.
				Trojans may hide in games, apps, or even software patches, or they may be embedded in attachments included in phishing emails.</p>

			 <H2> <li>Virus</li> </H2>
			<H3> <p>A virus is a piece of code that inserts itself into an application and executes when the app is run. 
				Once inside a network, a virus may be used to steal sensitive data, launch DDoS attacks or conduct ransomware attacks.</p>

				  <H2> <li>Spyware</li> </H2>
			<H3> <p>Spyware collects information about users’ activities without their knowledge or consent.
				This can include passwords, pins, payment information and unstructured messages.
				The use of spyware is not limited to the desktop browser: it can also operate in a critical app or on a mobile phone.</p>
