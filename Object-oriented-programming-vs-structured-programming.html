			<H3> <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a fundamental programming paradigm used by nearly every developer at some point in their career. 
				OOP is the most popular programming paradigm and is taught as the standard way to code for most of a programmers educational career.</p>
                      <p>Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects.
			      It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), 
			      which are used to create individual instances of objects. There are many object-oriented programming languages including JavaScript, C++, Java, and Python.

			   <H2> <li>Structured programming</li> </H2>
			<H3> <p>Structured programming (sometimes known as modular programming) is a programming paradigm that facilitates the creation of programs with readable code and reusable components. 
				All modern programming languages support structured programming, but the mechanisms of support, like the syntax of the programming languages, varies.</p>
                      <p>Where modules or elements of code can be reused from a library, it may also be possible to build structured code using modules written in different languages, 
			      as long as they can obey a common module interface or application program interface (API) specification. However, when modules are reused, it's possible to compromise data security and governance, 
			      so it's important to define and enforce a privacy policy controlling the use of modules that bring with them implicit data access rights.
