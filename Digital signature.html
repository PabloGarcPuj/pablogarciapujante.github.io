	<H3><p>Digital signatures are as <u>electronic “fingerprints”</u> In the form of a coded message,
		the digital signature securely associates a signer with a document in a recorded transaction.
		Digital signatures use a standard, accepted format, called Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), to provide the highest levels of security and universal acceptance.
		They are a <u>specific signature technology implementation of electronic signature</u> (eSignature). </p></H3>

       <H3> <p>The broad category of electronic signatures (eSignatures) encompasses many types of electronic signatures. 
		The category includes digital signatures, which are a specific technology implementation of electronic signatures. 
		Both digital signatures and other eSignature solutions allow you to sign documents and authenticate the signer. 
		However, there are differences in purpose, technical implementation, geographical use, and legal and cultural acceptance of digital signatures versus other types of eSignatures.</p>

         <p> In particular, the use of digital signature technology for eSignatures varies significantly between countries that follow open,
		 technology-neutral eSignature laws, including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, 
		 and those that follow tiered eSignature models that prefer locally defined standards that are based on digital signature technology, 
		 including many countries in the European Union, South America, and Asia. 
		 In addition, some industries also support specific standards that are based on digital signature technology.</p> </H3>
